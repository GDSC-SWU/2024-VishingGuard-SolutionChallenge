## ðŸš¨ Service Introduction
### Why do people fall victim to voice phishing? ðŸ¤”
The most emotionally compelling factor for humans is 'anxiety.' When receiving calls or messages that mention family, friends, or acquaintances and make financial demands, individuals are instantly engulfed in an emotional state of anxiety.   
While some can quickly discern voice phishing, most scammers do not give victims time to think, leading them to become victims of voice phishing in a blink of an eye.
### So...ðŸ’¡
Recognizing the need to safeguard the valuable assets cultivated throughout their lives, individuals often find themselves in need of a service to combat voice phishing. Hence, we initiated this project.   
Focusing on the evolving tactics of voice phishing that create problematic situations, we aim to provide a service to prevent voice phishing, an issue anyone can fall victim to.
## ðŸš¨ Our Goals
### Reduced Inequalities
ðŸŽ¯ **Digital Underprivileged Groups**   
Individuals with low digital literacy or limited access to information, such as the elderly and low-income populations, are more susceptible to voice phishing crimes.  
   
ðŸŽ¯ **Immigrants and International Students**   
Immigrants and international students become easy targets for voice phishing crimes due to their limited knowledge of the administrative systems in the host country.   
   
For these reasons, certain demographics are more likely to suffer financial losses compared to others, leading to inequality.   
As voice phishing can disproportionately impact economically vulnerable groups, it may contribute to inequalities in the restoration and recovery process for individuals affected.   
Preventing voice phishing contributes to enhancing the social safety of local communities. As inequalities diminish, it fosters a more equal and secure society, including specific demographics.   
### Sustainable Cities and Communities
We strive to create a society and city that protects assets and safeguards victims from the pervasive crime of voice phishing, a crime that anyone can fall victim to.   
Additionally, we aim to establish and operate more cohesive communities that prevent the creation of victims and assist those affected.   
Our service seeks to contribute to a society that embraces social vulnerabilities, becoming a secure settlement for all.
