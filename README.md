## 🚨 Service Introduction
### Why do people fall victim to voice phishing? 🤔
The most emotionally compelling factor for humans is 'anxiety.'   
When receiving calls or messages that mention family, friends, or acquaintances and make financial demands, individuals are instantly engulfed in an emotional state of anxiety.   
Most scammers do not give victims time to think, leading them to become victims of voice phishing in a blink of an eye.
### So...💡
We have recognized the need to protect individuals' valuable assets. Hence, we initiated this project. 
In addition, voice phishing crimes can occur to everyone, including the socially disadvantaged.   
To counter the increasingly sophisticated evolution of voice phishing techniques, we aim to provide a voice phishing crime prevention service.
## 🚨 Our Goals

### Reduced Inequalities
🎯 **Digital Underprivileged Groups**   
Individuals with low digital literacy or limited access to information, such as the elderly and low-income populations, are more susceptible to voice phishing crimes.  
   
🎯 **Immigrants and International Students**   
Immigrants and international students become easy targets for voice phishing crimes due to their limited knowledge about the administrative systems of the country.  
   
For these reasons, certain classes are more likely to suffer financial losses compared to others, which leads to inequality.   
As voice phishing can greater impact economically vulnerable groups, it may contribute to inequalities in the restoration and recovery process for individuals affected.   
Preventing voice phishing contributes to enhancing the social safety of local communities. As inequalities diminish, we can create an even and safe society, including certain classes.   
### Sustainable Cities and Communities
We strive to create a society and city that protects assets and safeguards victims from voice phishing crimes that anyone can suffer from.   
Additionally, we aim to establish and operate more cohesive communities that prevent the creation of victims and help victims.   
We want to be a service that contributes to a society that becomes a safe settlement that embraces the socially disadvantaged.
